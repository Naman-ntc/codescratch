It takes user input for the number of flowers, the number of subarrays, the moods of the flowers, and the descriptions of the subarrays. It then calls the `calculate_happiness()` function to calculate the maximum happiness Alyona can achieve and prints the result.\n# 2. `calculate_happiness(flowers_moods, subarrays)`: This function takes the moods of the flowers and the descriptions of the subarrays as input. It calculates the sum of each subarray by calling the `find_sum_subarray()` function. It sorts the sums in descending order and iterates through them, adding the positive sums to the total happiness. The function returns the maximum happiness that can be achieved.\n# 3. `find_sum_subarray(start, end, array)`: This function calculates the sum of a subarray given the start and end indices and the array of flower moods. It initializes a variable `total_sum` to 0 and iterates over the elements of the subarray, adding each element to the sum. It returns the total sum of the subarray.\n\ndef find_sum_subarray(start, end, array):\n    total_sum = 0\n    for i in range(start, end + 1):\n        total_sum += array[i]\n\n    return total_sum\n\n\ndef calculate_happiness(flowers_moods, subarrays):\n    sums = []\n    for subarray in subarrays:\n        subarray_sum = find_sum_subarray(subarray[0], subarray[1], flowers_moods)\n        sums.append(subarray_sum)\n\n    sums.sort(reverse=True)\n    happiness = 0\n    for sum in sums:\n        if sum <= 0:\n            break\n        happiness += sum\n    return happiness\n\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]\n\n    flowers_moods = [int(i) for i in input().split()]\n\n    subarrays = [[int(i) - 1 for i in input().split()] for j in range(m)]\n\n    print(calculate_happiness(flowers_moods, subarrays))\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()"
