It does this by iterating over the depot positions in reverse order, skipping `max_bags - 1` positions at a time. It returns the minimum distance.\n\nThe reason for this approach is that when carrying multiple bags at a time, it is optimal to deliver them to the farthest depots first.

Therefore, by delivering to the farthest depots first, the total distance covered is minimized.",

It sorts the array in descending order. It then iterates through the sorted array and keeps track of the minimum value between the current element and the next element. It returns this minimum value as the maximum possible minimum in the array.\n\nThe logic behind this approach is that the minimum extraction operation will always remove the smallest element in the array and subtract it from all other elements. Therefore, to maximize the minimum element in the array, we should always choose the smallest element that is greater than or equal to the current minimum. This is why we sort the array in descending order and keep track of the minimum value between the current element and the next element.",
